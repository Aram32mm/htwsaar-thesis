### ✅ Work Completed:

* **Project Setup**
  - Development environment initialized and repository structured  
  - Version control and basic CI/CD configured  
  - Initial folder structure and project modules defined

* **Review of RAG and AI/ML Fundamentals**
  - Studied core concepts including vector search (BM25, embeddings), Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines  
  - Assessed relevance of cross-encoders and hybrid ranking approaches in the domain of rule-based validation

* **Thesis Introduction Drafted**
  - Wrote the first version of the thesis introduction, including background, motivation, and problem definition  
  - Thesis structure and methodology overview discussed with the supervisor

* **Appendices A and B – Stakeholder Interviews**
  - Conducted interviews with Business Analysts (BSA) and industry supervisor
  - Extracted insights on existing validation challenges and desired system capabilities

* **Requirements Engineering – Version 1**
  - Drafted initial UI and functional requirements based on stakeholder input  
  - Outlined core features for the upcoming prototype and search module

### 🛠 Work Planned:

* Deepen system understanding and refine requirements  
* Develop initial PoC notebooks demonstrating RAG-based retrieval functionality  
* Experiment with different search strategies (e.g., embedding search, BM25, RRF)  
* Begin building the first version of the Dash-based prototype interface  

---

### ⚠️ Challenges:

* No critical issues so far  
* Minor delays in scheduling some stakeholder interviews, resolved without impacting overall timeline
