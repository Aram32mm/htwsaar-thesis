### ✅ Work Completed:

* **Dash App – Functional Prototype**

  * Completed development of an interactive Dash interface for retrieval validation
  * Integrated dynamic query handling, visual display of ranked results, and metadata panels

* **Retriever and Embeddings Integration**

  * Implemented end-to-end retriever module using sentence-transformer embeddings
  * Connected retriever with query pipeline for hybrid RAG workflows
  * Verified semantic search accuracy across small validation datasets

* **UI Development and Enhancement**

  * Designed cleaner layout with modular components for query input, result comparison, and rule traceability
  * Included performance stats and ranking source labels (e.g., “embedding,” “BM25”)

* **Pipeline Optimization (In Progress)**

  * Refactored data flow to minimize latency during inference
  * Profiling bottlenecks in pre-processing and ranking stages for tuning

---

### 🛠 Work Planned:

* Finalize pipeline optimization for speed and accuracy trade-offs
* Expand evaluation set and baseline metrics for initial performance testing
* Complete Methodology chapter with architecture diagrams and code summaries
* Begin outlining Results & Analysis chapter

---

### ⚠️ Challenges:

* Latency in embedding-based retrieval with larger datasets
* Maintaining component modularity while increasing feature complexity
