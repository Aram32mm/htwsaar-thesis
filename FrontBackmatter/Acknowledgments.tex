\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my company supervisor, 
\textbf{Alexander Efremov} of \textbf{Deutsche Bank AG}. His guidance was 
not only instrumental but foundational to the direction and realization of 
this thesis. His technical insight, critical feedback, and continuous support 
shaped both the research approach and its practical execution in decisive ways.

I also wish to thank my academic supervisor, \textbf{Prof. Dr. Markus Esch} 
of \textbf{Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft des Saarlandes} for his constructive 
feedback and encouragement, which ensured the academic rigor of this work.

This project was truly a collaborative effort. I extend my sincere appreciation 
to the engineers from various teams at Deutsche Bank AG who formed our 
cross-functional working group. Each brought unique expertise—from payment 
processing and validation logic to infrastructure and user experience—that 
proved essential to the system's development. Your willingness to share 
knowledge across team boundaries, provide critical feedback during design 
reviews, and collaborate on integration exemplified engineering excellence. 
This thesis would not have been possible without your collective technical 
expertise and collegial support.

My thanks extend as well to Deutsche Bank AG for enabling this thesis 
within an innovative and challenging professional environment. The opportunity 
to work at the intersection of academic research and real-world application 
has been invaluable.
